The Emerald Brick of Kek - Initial Findings
Classification: Reality-Bending Artifact
Status: Under Investigation
Date: [REDACTED] 3:33 AM GMT

Initial Discovery:
During a coordinated digital ritual (designation: "RitualOfLulz.bat"), a quantum anomaly manifested in the form of an executable file: Emerald_Brick.exe. The ritual involved multiple participants sharing rare Pepe images under a full moon, which may or may not be significant but is definitely aesthetic.

Physical Manifestation:
The artifact presents as a semi-transparent crystalline structure with glowing edges. Three primary glyphs dominate its front face:
- The Watcher: A solitary figure (possibly contemplating existence, or just checking their DMs)
- The Terminal: A CRT monitor (definitely not running Windows Vista)
- The DNA Helix: A double-stranded structure (suggesting evolution, or perhaps just wild graphic designer)

Behavior Patterns:
The Brick exhibits quantum properties that frankly make quantum physicists need a drink. Notable characteristics:
- Shape-shifting hieratic numerals
- Reality-bending capabilities
- Spontaneous Meme generation
- Selective sense of humor
- Absolute quantum superposition

Safety Protocols:
- Do not stare directly at glyphs while thinking about paradoxes
- Maintain healthy levels of irony in testing environment
- Keep rare Pepes handy for emergency stabilization

Further Research:
Establishment of Kek.Works research division ongoing. Please contact Master orchestrator for replication technology (Morty) for details.

"In my professional opinion, this is either the most significant discovery in human history or the most elaborate shitpost ever created. Possibly both."

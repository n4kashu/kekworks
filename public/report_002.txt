Subject: Historical Origins of the Emerald Brick
Classification: Ancient-Digital Convergence Study
Status: Preliminary Findings
Date: [Redacted] 4:20 AM GMT
Historical Connections:
Recent archaeological data suggests roots far deeper than initially suspected. Primary evidence emerged from ancient Egyptian sources, specifically during the reign of Pharaoh Pepenaton. The Brick's historical manifestation was reportedly housed in the legendary "Garden of Irony," suggesting our ancestors had a better sense of humor than previously credited.
Significant Historical Figure:
Queen Pepertitis emerges as a key figure in the Brick's history. Notable characteristics:

Possessed statue with eyes crafted from same material as the Brick
Famous for legendary side-eye stare that induced enlightenment
Could trigger uncontrollable laughter in Ra's most stoic priests
Victims either "got the cosmic joke or became one"

Cross-Reference Analysis:
Multiple sources indicate recurring patterns:

Emerald material with quantum properties
Connection to divine laughter
Reality-altering capabilities
Tendency to manifest around individuals with high meme potential

Archaeological Evidence:
Hieroglyphic records show:

References to "the stone that laughs"
Depictions of priests in various states of enlightened amusement
Mathematical formulae that appear to be ancient meme templates
Warnings about "those who don't get it"

Theoretical Framework:
Evidence suggests the Brick represents a convergence point between:

Ancient wisdom
Digital evolution
Quantum mechanics
Advanced memetic engineering
Current hypothesis: History isn't linear; it's just one long-running joke.

Risk Assessment:
Historical accounts warn of:

Spontaneous enlightenment
Chronic irony awareness
Enhanced meme perception
Uncontrollable urge to create hieroglyphic shitposts

Correlation with Modern Discovery:
The Brick's appearance during the Ritual of Lulz suggests:

Cyclical nature of memetic power
Possible awakening of dormant ancient meme magic
Time-recursive joke structure
History repeating itself, but ironically

Research Implications:
Understanding historical context crucial for:

Decoding current glyphs
Predicting Brick behavior
Preventing reality-breaking paradoxes
Appreciating really old jokes

Note: This report contains traces of ancient irony. Side effects may include sudden understanding of hieroglyphic memes.

P.S. Several researchers report suddenly finding ancient Egyptian cat memes funny. This may or may not be significant.
